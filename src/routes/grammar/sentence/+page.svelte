			<h3 class="text-2xl">The sentence structure</h3>
			<hr/>

			<p>
				In skylang, the basic sentence structure follows the subject-verb-object (SVO) order.
				for example, let's write the sentence "I eat a fruit" in skylang.
			</p>

			<br/>
			<h4 class="text-xl">Your first words</h4>
			<hr/>
			<br/>

			<p>
				First, let's translate the 3 words individually :
			</p>
			<div class="flex flex-row items-center justify-center">
				<img src="/grammar/I_symbol.png" alt="i symbol" class="w-1/2 h-auto mt-4 mb-4" />
			</div>

			<p>
				The subject "I" is represented by the symbol above. It is made of 4 keys :
				ground, person, claws and ground again. A good memo is "when I look at the ground, I see my own claws".
			</p>

			<div class="flex flex-row items-center justify-center">
				<img src="/grammar/eat_symbol.png" alt="eat symbol" class="w-1/2 h-auto mt-4 mb-4" />
			</div>

			<p>
				The verb "eat" is represented by the symbol above. It is made of 3 keys :
				claws, sun (mouth) and food. The claws mean that it is a verb (action) conjugated at present tense.
				The food symbol is in the mouth, which make it easy to understand.
			</p>

			<div class="flex flex-row items-center justify-center">
				<img src="/grammar/fruit_symbol.png" alt="fruit symbol" class="w-1/2 h-auto mt-4 mb-4" />
			</div>

			<p>
				The object "fruit" is represented by the symbol above. It is made of 3 keys :
				ground, food and ground again, because the fruits come from the soil, the ground.
			</p>

			<br/>
			<h4 class="text-xl">Building the sentence</h4>
			<hr/>
			<br/>

			<p>
				Once you have the 3 symbols, building the basic sentence is pretty easy :
				just put the subject symbol first, then the verb symbol, and finally the object symbol :
			</p>

			<div class="flex flex-row items-center justify-center">
				<img src="/grammar/i_eat_fruit.png" alt="i eat fruit sentence" class="w-1/2 h-auto mt-4 mb-4" />
			</div>
